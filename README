This distribution contains the benchmarks used to collect timings and
operation counts for FFC-generated and Excafé-generated finite element
local assembly implementations.

Build dependencies include Boost (http://www.boost.org/), the Apache
Portable Runtime (https://apr.apache.org/) and PAPI
(http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/).

On Debian/Ubuntu systems, Boost can be found in the libboost-dev
package, APR in the libapr1-dev package. PAPI most likely will need to
be built from source.

To build:

- If configure is not present, run ./bootstrap
- Run:

    ./configure --with-papi=${PAPI_PREFIX} 

  where ${PAPI_PREFIX} is your PAPI install location.

- Run 'make' inside the respective benchmark folders.

Any files with a '.h' extension were most likely generated by FFC or
Excafé and included with the distribution. Running a 'make clean' will
erase these, at which point the build scripts will attempt to regenerate
them using an Excafé or FFC install on the local system. At present the
Excafé location is hard-coded in benchmark.mk.in.
